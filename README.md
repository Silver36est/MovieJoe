App to suggest random movie to watch.

Project requires Java 11 and Angular 13

When you have difficulty with choosing a movie to watch, then our app can help. 
It's easy to use and you don't need an account to use the main function, which is choosing random movie from our database. 
But when you want to participate in growing the database and see full movie list, then you have a chance to register your account. 

We used Java 11 for back-end and Angular 13 for front-end.
We also used angular's material tools and bootstrap for styling and Spring framework in backend v2.6.1. 
Angular project is in UI folder and we have made everything into separate components, so the code would be bit more readable and easier to edit.
